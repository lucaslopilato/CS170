P3A Report
P3B Report submitted for the P3B submission portion

1. MIPS Binary instruction: Load Word(lw), SC_EXEC, SC_CREATE, SC_OPEN
2. TestVMFork.c can be ran smoothly because the memory is never requested.
   This means that a page fault never occurs, resulting in that function
   never being called.
3. In part A, only the page fault handler was implemented. The purpose of this
   section is to locate and handle a page fault in the case that a page was 
   requested that is not in the page table. 
   In the implementation first, we locate the physical page info for the current
   possible victim. We then cyccle through page entries. If the current page 
   entry is unused or NULL, we select that as the victim. Otherwise we set the
   page's use bit to 0 and keep moving. This implements the 2nd change algo.
   
   If we found an empty victim page slot, we load the new space, info, index, 
   and entry into the space. If the victim slot is filled with a page, we write
   the victim page to the swap space, set the dirty bit to false, then overwrite
   the space with the new page.
